#### Fragment Lengths

The R object `fragment_lengths.rds` includes the fragment lengths for the mutant and wild-type alleles for tumor-specific and CHIP (Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential) mutations, as well as germline variants.

The fragment lengths are derived by extracting the insert size field from the targeted sequencing bam file.
